# HSlider
<< Horizontal slider >>
Using jQuery 3.5.1

See "https://apilogik.github.io/Hslider/index.html";

As a "padawan" in web development, starting this year (2020), the sole purpose of this slider is JavaScript (jQuery) training.

I know that there are hundreds of frameworks and libraries that do the same, and better, but I wanted to make one from the scratch only as learning experience.
